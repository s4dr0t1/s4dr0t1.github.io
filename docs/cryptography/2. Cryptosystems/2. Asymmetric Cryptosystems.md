## Asymmetric Cryptosystems

### Basics
Unlike Symmetric Cryptography, two keys are used in Asymmetric Cryptosystems, a public and a private, which is why it's also known as Two-Key Crypto or Public Key Encryption. Both the keys are mathematically related, yet one can't be derived from its other counterpart.

If our plaintext is encrypted with key X, its decryption will be done with the help of its other counterpart key Y, and it's not possible to encrypt and decrypt with the same key.

Asymmetric Cryptography is extremely slow and mathematically intensive, which is why, instead of using them for transmission of data across the network, we use them for key-exchange instead.

### The Keys
Public Key | Private Keys
-|-
Can be shared publicly | Must be kept private at all times

## How is it implemented?
### As a secure channel for transmission
Bob, the business owner of a high-tech company doing active research in cutting edge tech, is currently on a holiday. Due to some business urgency, he has requested his IT department for access to a sensitive file. How will the IT department send him the sensitive file in a way nobody else can get their hands on it while it's being transmitted over the Internet? They will use Public Key Cryptography for this purpose.

Following steps take place:
- The data is encrypted using Bob's public key X, which is known by the IT department
- The encrypted file is received by Bob, over the Internet
- Bob has his private key, which is in fact, known only to him. Knowledge of this private key implies it's Bob
- Bob is able to decrypt the file using his private key

Since the file is encrypted using Bob's public key, and can't be decrypted by nothing other than Bob's private key, confidentiality is ensured. 
If Bob is able to decrypt the file, it also implies it's Bob. On the other hand, since the public key of Bob is common knowledge to all, authentication isn't there, since anyone can encrypt a file with Bob's public key and send it over to Bob

### Open Message Format
Unlike the other method discussed above, what if we encrypt a file using my private key and sent it to anyone. Anyone who's received that file, will be able to decrypt it in a heartbeat, since my public key is, well public knowledge. We can say that no confidentiality is ensured, but at the same time, one can say if a file is getting decrypted with the help of my public key, it must have been encrypted with my private key in the first place, which is known only to me. One say state that it was me who encrypted the file, ensuring the concept of Non-Repudiation.

Following steps take place:
- The file is encrypted using Bob's private key by Bob, because he's the only one who knows it
- The file is sent over the Internet, to the recipient
- The recipient after receiving it, decrypt the file using Bob's public key. If decryption is successful, it's implied that it was sent by Bob (non-repudiation)
