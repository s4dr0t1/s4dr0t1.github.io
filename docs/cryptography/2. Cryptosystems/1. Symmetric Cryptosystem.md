```
A cryptosystem consists of three things:
- Key generation cipher
- Encryption cipher
- Decryption cipher
```

## Basics

![Symmetric Cryptography](/img/docs/crypto/cryptosystems/symmetric.png)

- Uses the same (and only) key for both encryption and decryption purposes, which is why it's known as Symmetric.
- Due to the usage of a single key, it's also sometimes referred to as Single Key Cryptography, or Secret Key Encryption. The key must be protected and properly managed at all costs.
- The primary purpose of this type of cryptosystem is ensuring confidentiality, and has nothing to do with non-repudiation
- Symmetric Cryptography is very fast in nature, because of their inherent mathematical simplicity, and the lack of any key management techniques, reducing the overhead.
- The key used is known as the **Secret Key** which must be protected and properly managed at all costs.
- Some examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard), RC4 etc.

## Categories of Symmetric Key Algorithms

### Stream Cipher

- One byte of data is encrypted at a time, with a different key, and thus each byte is decrypted with its own different key.
- Key reuse must never be there, otherwise the whole cryptosystem would break

### Block Cipher

- The plaintext is segreagated into blocks of n-characters (bits) and the mathematical functions are applied on a block at the same time, unlike Stream Cihpers, where it happens one-byte at a time.
- The key used to encrypt the blocks is same for all the blocks.
- If our input data is smaller than the block size specified, the missing bits gets padded to fill up the gap.

## Key Exchange in Symmetric Cryptosystems

### Why is key exchange required?

Symmetric Key Cryptography, by its design, is secure and fast in nature, but it gets a bit problematic around Key Exchange.

Consider an example, Bob wants to send Linda an encrypted message, he uses a Symmetric Cipher (say AES) with his key to encrypt the message. The encrypted attachment is ready to be sent over the Internet, but once Linda receives the same, how is she going to open the attachment? She doesn't know the key herself. 

If we think about how, she can obtain the key by the following methods:
- She could call Bob up and ask for the key, which by the way doesn't scale at all, and there are inherent security risks in that too.
- She could email him, again security risks because a key is a very private entity.
- She could meet Bob in person? This would work well too, but it's not applicable in every scenario, what if we want to send the file to someone we've never met before?

Solutions like this generally come to our mind, but it doesn't scale at all, and are not possible all the times. Scientists have come up with some marvellous techniques by which a key exchange can take place. We will be talking about them now. Some are:
- Using Pre-Shared Keys 
- Using Asymmetric Cryptography
- Using Diffie-Helman Key Exchange
