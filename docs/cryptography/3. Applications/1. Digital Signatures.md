>A post about Digital Signatures, and their importance in ensuring non-repudiation, authentication and message integrity of data.

## Basics

### Understanding Digital Signatures

I had written in [Hashing](../cryptosystems/hashing) , about the risk of an attacker acting as the *man-in-the-middle* b/w the sender and the receiver, and modifying both the file in transit and its corresponding hash which is supposedly used to file integrity verification. This type of risk can be dealt with, with the help of **Digital Signatures**, which is a combination of both [Hashing](../cryptosystems/hashing#message-integrity)& [Public Key Cryptography](../cryptosystems/asymmetric#as-a-secure-channel-for-transmission).

Digital Signature is analogous to how signatures work in real life, as a stamp of approval, but way more advanced. If we get a paper signed& stamped by a competent authority, we can use that to get some work done somewhere else.

With the help of Digital Signatures, we can make sure neither the file nor the hash has been tampered with (Hashing Algorithm), and at the same time, make sure nor the hash has been replaced, with some bogus one (Public Key Cryptography)

### How are signatures generated?

- The file is hashed first, and the hash generated is encrypted with the Private Key of the sender, which is then tied alongside the original file acting as a digital signature
- The package is then sent to another entity, which can verify the authenticity, by using the sender's public key to decrypt the signature, and cross-check with the signature obtained to make sure neither the hash nor the file has been modified in transit.
- It is important to note here that this technique is similar to the [Open Message Format](../cryptosystems/asymmetric#open-message-format) as discussed in the previous section, the only difference being the file is hashed before encrypted with the sender's public key in Digital Signatures as opposed to just simply encrypting it. This increases the operational speed by leaps and bounds because Asymmetric Cryptography is mathematically intensive, the larger the input size, the larger the overhead. Hashing the file beforehand ensures the input file is of a consistent size no matter what the original size is, and also helps in verifying the message-integrity of the data, not just non-repudiation.

## What does it ensures?

### Authentication and Non-Repudiation

Digital Signatures also help us with authentication of the sender. If we're able to decrypt the signature with X's public key, it is certain that the hash was encrypted with the X's private key in the first place, only which X has possession of. And we can say it was X who sent the message. With the same logic, the sender can never deny that the message was not sent by him because it has been signed by his/ her private key.

### Data Integrity Of The File And The Hash

With the help of digital signatures, we can make sure that the neither the file nor the hash has been altered in transit. If any man-in-the-middle is fiddling with our traffic, he can still tamper the file, but he will not be able to digitally sign the file as per the sender's identity because he's not in possession of the sender's private key. If he signs he file with his private key, we will not be able to decrypt the signature the the sender's public key.
