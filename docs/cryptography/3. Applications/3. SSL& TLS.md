### Basics

- SSL stands for **Secure Socket Layer** and TLS stands for **Transport Layer Security**. TLS is the updated version of SSL.
- These protocols are used for encrypting web traffic by leveraging symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, and normally work over Port 445/tcp by default.
- Asymmetric Cryptography is used as a key exchange method to negotiate a symmetric session key b/w the sender and the receiver, and the Symmetric Session key, in turn is used to encrypt data b/w the parties involved.

### SSL Behind The Scenes

We open the browser, enter a URL. Stuff like DNS resolution, packet routing and stuff takes place ([More info](https://github.com/alex/what-happens-when#dns-lookup)).
Client initializes a TCP connection with the destination server, and the server indicates the need for a SSL connection

- Client sends a `client-hello` message, and also sends a list of cryptographic information (supported ciphers, key lengths, SSL version, data compression supported etc) which are used by the browser
- The incoming information is acknowledged by the server, and the server looks for a middle ground, which things are supported by both of them. 
	- If there's none compatible, we get a cryptographic compatibility error message. 
	- Otherwise the compatible ciphersuite will be used
	- If there's more than one compatible ciphersuite, the best one will be picked up.
- The server sends back a `hello` message with the agreed ciphersuite for the browser to be used, and also its Digital Certificate
- The client loads the ciphersuite, and checks the Digital Certificate
	- Whether the certificate has been expired or note
	- Whether the certificate has been revoked or not
- If all of the above checks succeed, a *Symmetric* session key is generated (which is supposedly to be used by the two parties involved for encryption of data)
- The recently generated symmetric session key is encrypted with the receiver's public key, sent over to the network
- The other party decrypts the encrypted message with its private key, and use the session key for encrypting the communication b/w the two parties
