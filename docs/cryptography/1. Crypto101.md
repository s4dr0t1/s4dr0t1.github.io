# Introduction
So, this will be completely elementary to bring you up to speed about what it is what I am writing about, so that you'll be able to understand some basic terminology that will be mentioned in the later parts of this Cryptography series. :)

## Breaking down the terminology

### Cryptology
It's the generic term consisting of both Cryptography and Cryptanalysis

### Cryptography
It's all about building, designing and deploying the algorithms used to hide information from prying eyes. It's sometimes also abbreviated simply as just 'Crypto' and the people who practice Cryptography are known as **Cryptograhers**.

To understand it better, we can conside this analogy: Cryptographers are like the software development team at an organisation, their aim is to build things.

### Cryptanalysis
This sub-field is all about testing and verifying the strength of Cryptographic algorithms and finding potential security holes. The people who practice this are known as Cryptanalysts.

We can consider this analogy: They're the Quality Assurance and Testing team of an organisation.

## Core Components Of Cryptography

### Encryption
- Encryption is the encoding of messages so that its real meaning is concealed. We can encrypt anything (read message) to protect our sensitive information from prying eyes.
- How the message is going to get garbled, depends on the Cryptography Cipher used

### Decryption
It's a mathematical operation which is used to reverse our ciphertext back into its original form.

### Ciphertext (Cryptogram)
- Once the message has been transformed into garbled text by a cryptographic cipher, the resulting form is known as a Ciphertext.
- A ciphertext is supposed to have no meaning at all and should be very random in nature viz. no patterns at all

### The Algorithm (Cipher)
- It's a mathematical transformation that operates on characters at the binary level and gives shape to how the ciphertext is going to look at the end.
- A cipher can be Cryptographic in nature (like RSA), or simply non-Cryptographic (such as ROT-13). But in case of encryption, algorithm or cipher, we generally mean Cryptographic Algorithm.
- These algorithms are publicly documented and scrutinized by the Cryptography community around the world. Before one can be used, it undergoes heavy testing and research, and only after one is considered safe, is implemented in real life.

### The Key
- A key is simply a string of binary data used to initialise a particular encryption/ decryption algorithm
- It's extremely important to properly protect and manage the key. A weaker key will also lead to weaker protection.
- The length of the key is extremely important. The larger the better, because a bigger size will be computationally complex to generate because of more number of possibilities. A 40-bit key will have 2^40 possibilities, and on the other hand, a 128-bit will have 2^128, making it harder to compute the key, and thus offering more protection.

## Goals And Challenges In Cryptography
### The Challenges
- Making sure our information is protected at rest
- Making sure the information is protected during transit
- Making sure the keys are properly protected and managed

## The Goals
:::danger Confidentiality
:::
Our information shouldn't be read by anyone else other than for whom it's supposed to be

:::danger Integrity
:::
Our information shouldn't be altered by a third party at all costs.

:::danger Authentication
:::
The receiver must properly authenticate themselves before receiving our data.

:::danger Non-Repudiation
:::
It must be absolutely clear who sent the message, so that the sender can't deny it later on.
