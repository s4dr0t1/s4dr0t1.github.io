>A series of elementary posts, to bring one up to speed about things we read every now and then, in the information security space regarding Cryptography. Digital Certificates, Hashing Algorithms et cetera

## Breaking down the terminology

Name | Description
-|-
Cryptology | It's the generic (umbrella) term consisting of both Cryptography and Cryptanalysis
Cryptography (Crypto) | <li>It's all about building, designing and deploying the algorithms used to protect our information from prying eyes, and is done by by ***Cryptographers***</li><li>To understand it better, we can conside this analogy: Cryptographers are like the software development team at an organisation, their aim is to build things.</li>
Cryptanalysis | This sub-field is all about testing and verifying the strength of Cryptographic algorithms and finding potential security holes, done by ***Cryptanalysys***.

## Core Components Of Cryptography

![Encryption](/img/docs/crypto/crypto101/encryption.png)

Name | Description
-|-
Encryption | <li>Encryption is the garbling of messages so that its real meaning is concealed. We can encrypt anything (read _message_) to protect our sensitive information from prying eyes.</li><li>How the message is going to get garbled, depends on the **_Cipher_** used</li>
Decryption | It's a mathematical operation which is used to reverse our ciphertext back into its original form.
Plaintext | Data in its original format and can be read and understood normally.
Ciphertext | <li>After the message has been transformed, the resulting gibberish is known as Ciphertext.</li><li>It's completely random in nature, and is supposed to have no meaning at all. If some patterns can be observed, they can be exploited. </li>

## Components of Encryption and Decryption

![Algorithm and key](/img/docs/crypto/crypto101/cipher.png)

Name | Description
-|-
The Algorithm (Cipher) | <li>It's a mathematical transformation that operates on characters at the binary level and gives shape to how the ciphertext is going to look at the end.</li> <li>A cipher usually works in conjunction with a key, which is used in the encryption/ decryption process.</li> <li>A cipher can be Cryptographic in nature (like RSA), or non-Cryptographic (such as ROT-13). But in case of encryption, algorithm or cipher, we generally mean Cryptographic Algorithm.</li> <li>A good cryptographic algorithm is publicly documented, scrutinized and tested against, for years, if not decades, before being put to real world use.</li>
The Key | <li>A string of binary data used to initialise a particular encryption/ decryption algorithm</li> <li>The strength of key depends upon its size, and the algorithm used to generate it. It's extremely important to have key management and protection techniques in place.</li> <li>The length of the key is extremely important. The larger the better, because a bigger size will be computationally complex to generate because of more number of possibilities. A 40-bit key will have 2^40 possibilities, and on the other hand, a 128-bit will have 2^128, making it harder to compute the key, and thus offering more protection.</li>

## Goals And Challenges In Cryptography

### The Challenges

- Making sure our information is protected at rest
- Making sure our information is protected during transit
- Making sure our keys are properly protected and managed

### The Goals

- **Confidentiality**: Our information shouldn't be read by anyone else other than for whom it's supposed to be
- **Integrity**: Our information shouldn't be altered by a third party at all costs.
- **Authentication**: The receiver must properly authenticate themselves before receiving our data.
- **Non-Repudiation**: It must be absolutely clear who sent the message, so that the sender can't deny it later on.
