> Understanding some basic stuff about Operating Systems

## What is an Operating System

It's a program that controls the execution of other programs running on the system. It's used to abstract away the hardware-complexities by acting as a layer b/w programs and the hardware and doing all the heavy lifting

It can be categorized based on different methodologies, the most common ones are: 
- Based on the usage
- Based on how it's designed

## Classification based on the usage

### Batch Operating Systems

- In batch operating systems, there is no direct interaction b/w the end user and the OS, instead whatever the user wants the OS to do, he/ she prepares the job on an offline device (punch card and the likes)
- The job is then submitted to the computer operator who uses his/ her own discretion and group the jobs together into batches
- The batches are then fed to the computer by the computer operator, and the computer performs those tasks


### Time Sharing Operating Systems

These are used when multiple users have access to the same hardware, and we need to coordinate their access to the limited resources.

### Network Operating Systems

A network OS runs on a server and provides the server capabilities to manage data, user, groups, security and stuff.

### Real Time Operating Systems

These are used when we need fine-grained time precision, execution and responsiveness. Think of stuff like Military and Nuclear Facilities

### Distributed Operating Systems

Used when the hardware is physically distributed and a single OS needs to coordinate their access and distribute data processing jobs among all those processors, all having their own memory, and also ensuring communication b/w them.

## Classification of OS'es on the basis of design and supported features

### Monolithic (Non-Modular)

> Monolithic architecture stands for having a single codebase and a single data-layer. Every function is tightly coupled with each other

![Monolithic Kernel](/img/docs/os/kernel/non-modular-monolith.png)

- The entire OS runs in a high-privileged kernel space and acts as a supervisor for other programs. Every single thing (even the ones used very less) are already included in the system 
- Since everything is included beforehand, and no plug-and-play capability, its bigger in size, has bigger memory requirements, and due to the tightly coupled nature of the code-base, its hard to maintain and debug.

### Modular Monolith

![Non-Modular Monolith](/img/docs/os/kernel/modular-monolith.png)

- This technique is an intermediary ground b/w the other two. A monolith is designed with an emphasis of interchangeable (and potentially reusable modules)
- Both modular and non-modular monoliths are a single deployment unit, while microservices can be deployed independently of each other.
- A modular OS has basic services and API part of the core, and the functionality can be augmented by adding new modules dynamically (kind of plug-and-plasy)
- Modules are easier to maintain, and can be developed independent to the OS kernel because they're loaded dynamically.

### Microservices Based

> Microservices Architecture involves smaller applications deployed independently as loosely coupled units which communicate with each other via APIs and they're not coupled with each other.

- The previously monolithic OS features are broken down into smaller parts that run either run in the Kernel-Mode / User-mode, and all of them are independent of each other.
- Since all of the services are very loosely coupled, its very easy to maintain.

## What is the need of an Operating System?

> Consider an application which is supposed to play an audio file which exists on a disk

- One approach is not having any Operating System, and make the application directly run on the hardware w/o any abstraction. The programmer would then have to, write the complete application logic, and also the low level code to interact with the hardware, which would take a lot of developmental efforts.
Also, the application might not be able to handle some architecture at all, and neither will we able to run multiple application simultaneously.

- Another approach is to have an intermediary ground to facilitate all interaction with the hardware on behalf of the application, and handle all the low level intricacies, providing abstraction for the music application. That's the use of Operating System for you.


Which approach is better? You be the judge! :)
