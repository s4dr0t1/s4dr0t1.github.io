> How usermode applications are able to interact with the Kernel: System Calls& Trap Instructions

## Basics

### Introduction

In the previous section, I mentioned about Ring-3 applications being able to access privileged stuff through some sort of mechanism. We're gonna talk about that more here, there are two techniques: System Calls& Trap Instructions. But before that, we must first understand what an **Interrupt** is.

### Interrupt 

- An interrupt is a signal that can be sent to the processor by the hardware/ software components, denoting there's an event which needs ***immediate*** attention
- The processor upon receiving the signal, calls an Interrupt Handler (Interrupt Service Routine - ISR) to deal with the urgent event.
- Once the event has been dealt with, things go back to normal
- **Example**: When we hit a key on the keyboard, the response on the screen is instantaneous. How does this work? It's the magic of Interrupt signals

## System Calls

### Basics

- Since usermode programs can't perform privileged operations directly, they must depend on other mechanisms to do the same, one of which is by a technique called **System-Calls**.
- These system calls are not used directly, rather system libraries are used which do some error checking, and the libraries, in turn make calls into the Kernel with the help of System Call table by sending an **interrupt** to the CPU which then invokes an interrupt handler to deal with the interrupt.
- There are two types of System Calls: Synchronous and Asynchronous. In the former, the usermode process will wait for it to complete its operation, and in the latter, it'll not, and operations will continue as normal

### System Call Table		

It's an array maintained by the kernel which maps individual system call names and numbers to the corresponding code inside the Kernel needed to handle each system call viz. its an array of pointers which points to the *actual* kernel code.

### Behind The Scenes Of A System Call 

- When a system call is made with the help of system APIs, the context changes and control is handed to the OS. Arguments are passed b/w memory regions for cooperation.
- The flow then jumps to the kernel memory space, and instructions are then executed pertaining to the system call.
- When everything is done, control is handed back to the calling process, and context is changed again, some argument passing again, and we jump back to the same address where we came from.

## Trap Instructions

- Another way a user-mode application can interact with Kernel mode other than an interrupt is by a Trap Instruction
- This special type of exception can be caused when a user-mode application tries to do something illegal which is only allowed for privileged applications
- A Trap Instruction is an exception in the user process where the instruction can't be restarted, on the other hand a Fault is an exception where the instruction can be restarted
- The OS will then decide how to deal with this trap instruction, should it terminate the process or let it flow.
