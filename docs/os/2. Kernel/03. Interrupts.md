> Getting attention of the microprocessor, the what, why and how?


## Basics

:::info 
Ever wonder whenever we type something on the keyboard, the keypress is _almost_ immediately registered and shown in front of the screen? 

The magic is done through interrupts (and some other things such as device drivers, I/O controllers which are out of scope of this current post, and will be covered later)
:::

An interrupt is a signal which can be sent to the microprocessor either via hardware or software components, to let it know that there is an urgent event which needs **immediate** attention.

## How the microprocessor comes to know about an interrupt?

The microprocessor senses Interrupts after executing an instruction, with the help of _Interrupt Request Lines_. As and when, there is a signal present on the IRL, the microprocessor decides accordingly whether to handle (_service_) it or not.

In modern hardware, there is suppose for multi-priority interrupts to differ b/w low priority and high priority interrupts, which is facilitated by multiple request lines:
- **Non-maskable interrupt lines**: Reserved for extremely fatal and sensitive situations such as memory loss, traps etc
- **Maskable interrupt lines**: Reserved for generic use cases such as system calls, and this line can be turned off by the CPU before executing critical instructions


## How are interrupts handled?

Whenever the microprocessor senses an interrupt through the Interrupt Request Lines, it must decide whether it must be serviced or not based on the priority. Traps on the other hand, are non-maskable and must be handled by the microprocessor as and when they occur.

The microprocessor saves the current execution context of whatever is being executed (we'll learn more about process context and Process Control Block later) and jumps `jmp` to a specific area in the memory to a subroutine which can handle the interrupt known as **ISR** (Interrupt Service Routines or Interrupt Handlers). The said can be achieved via many ways: 

Interrupt mechanism | Description
-|-
Generic Interrupt Handling | <li>On every interrupt, the execution flow is redirected to a pre-defined area in memory, which is the starting address of the generic ISR</li><li>The generic ISR then inspects the registers, probes the buses and obtains other information, to find which device needs servicing.</li><li>The generic ISR then, calls the device specific interrupt handler to service the interrupt</li><li>The downside of this methodology is that interrupts must be handled very fast. If the number of devices is too large, generic interrupt handling becomes a problem because the generic ISR would then have to probe through a lot of devices to find which device needs servicing</li>
Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) mechanism | <li>The solution to the aforementioned problem in the previous section, is to not jump to a generic ISR, and instead directly jump to the ISR which can service the interrupt, completely bypassing the generic interrupt handling stage</li> <li>This is facilitated by having a special array known as Interrupt Vector Table (IVT), which stores pointers to base addresses of different interrupt handlers</li><li>When an device issues an interrupt, it stores the Interrupt Number into a specific registers, which is then read and is used as an index into the array to find the address of the ISR</li><li>The `IDTR` register is used to store the base address of the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT)/ Interrupt Vector Table (IVT)</li><li>The base addresses of interrupts handlers for different devices gets known at the boot time, by the OS, by probing the hardware buses and determining which devices are present</li>
Interrupt Chaining | <li>The purpose of vectored interrupt mechanism is to save time which gets wasted in looking for which devices that need servicing, and the ISR address, but the vector table is fixed in size and can only store only a limited pointers, a combination of basic and IVT mechanism must be used in modern hardware to _really_ facilitate interrupts, and this technique is known as **Interrupt Chaining**</li><li>In interrupt chaining, some indexes to the array contain pointers to specific ISRs, and some containing chained interrupt handlers viz. it points to the base address of a list, containing many ISR addresses.</li><li>When an interrupt is raised, the ISRs are called one by one until one is found which can service the interrupt</li><li>This technique is a compromise b/w overhead of a large Interrupt Vector Table and the inefficiency of generic interrupt handling</li>

:::info Multi-level Interrupt Handling
Nowadays, modern systems split the interrupt handling stage into multiple parts
- **FLIH** (First Level Interrupt Handler): Deals with saving the information of the currently executing process and context switching
- **SLIH** (Second Level Interrupt Handler): Deals with actually servicing the interrupt

## What happens after an interrupt

Once the event related to the interrupt signal is handled, the suspended process is then resumed.

## Different categorization of interrupts

Type | Description
-|-
Vectored and non-vectored | <li>**Vectored Interrupts**: The address of the ISR is hard-wired and thereâ€™s no need to tell the microprocessor about it</li><li>**Non-vectored Interrupts**: Address of the ISR needs to be communicated to the microprocessor.</li>
Software and hardware interrupts | <li>**Software Interrupts**: Invoked by a software component for purposes such as system calls on older processors</li><li>**Hardware interrupts**: Invoked by a hardware component and is used as a way for an I/O device to communicate with the microprocessor. </li>
Maskable and Non-maskable Interrupts | <li>**Maskable Interrupts**: These signals are sent over maskable IRLs and can be ignored by the microprocessor if need be, as they're mostly low priority interrupts</li><li>**Non-maskable Interrupts**: They are extremely important and can't be ignored by the microprocessor, such as Trap. They're very high priority interrupts</li>
