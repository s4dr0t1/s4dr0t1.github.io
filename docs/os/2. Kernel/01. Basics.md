A special portion of the Operating System, which exists in a *protected-and-reserved* area of the memory, and it acts as an interface b/w hardware and the programs.
We call the protected area of memory it runs in as [Kernel Space](./protection-rings)

The most sensitive parts of the OS are contained in the Kernel, such as:

- Filesystem Management
- Hardware Management
- Interrupt Control
- Memory Management
- Inter-Process Communication Management
- Process& Thread Management etc
