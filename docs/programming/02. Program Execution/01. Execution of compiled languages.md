# Different steps of compilation

There is a lot of stuff, so we will try to go through them one by one, also we will look at the process from the view of the C programming language.

## Writing code

For the code to compile, we need to write the code in the first place, this part is all about writing the code, which is an integral part of the [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle).

## Pre-processing

In this phase, the pre-processor does removal of comments, and other special statements such as preprocessor directives and deal with them accordingly. For example, if we are including the `stdio` library in our code, `#include <stdio.h>`, the preprocessor will put all the function prototypes into our main code, so that the compiler can figure out what kind of arguments can be passed to the function, whether it's defined locally, or can it be discovered in some other library

```sh
$ cpp <filename.c> | less
#or 
$ clang -E <filename.C> | less
```

## Compilation

### What are compilers?

- Speaking in a generic sense, compilers are used to convert code written in one language to another. The notion that compilers translate HLLs to low-level languages is prevalent, but not necessary, as it can also be used to convert b/w two HLLs (see [Transpilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler)), for example [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
- Apart from code translation, they are also used in code optimization and error handling

![Preprocessing](/img/docs/programming/execution/compiler-basic.png)

### Overview of C compilation

- The C compiler takes HLL source code and converts it into an intermediate form called object code.
- The conversion from HLL to machine code is done all at once, which is why this type of compilation is known as [Ahead Of Time Compilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation) (AOT).
T- The outcome of the compilation phase is multiple object files (`.o`, `.obj`), which are native to our ISA and microarchitecture, the only difference being they contain additional metadata such as relocation table, symbol table and what not, to augment the Linking step, in order to make the executable blocks identifiable and relocatable.
- Has a lot of sub-phases: Lexical Analysis, Syntax Analysis, Semantic Analysis, Intermediate Code Generation, Code Optimization and Code Generation, and we will go through them one by one.

### Lexical Analysis (Tokenisation) 

- The lexical analyzer breaks down the source program into lexical units (or _lexemes_), which are things which hold some meaning such as identifiers, special words, operators, punctuation symbols etc.
- Error checking is also done at this stage, if some characters are not allowed, the lexical analyzer reports them to us.

```cpp
String greeting = "Hello";
/*
	Five lexemes are there:
	- String
	- greeting 
	- = 
	- "hello"
	- ;
*/
```


### Parsing (Syntax Analysis)

- The syntax analyzer takes in the sequence of tokens generated at the previous step, to create hierarchical structures called **Parse Trees**, which represent the logical structure of a program, and the original source code can also be obtained back from the Parse Tree by walking the tree down the right order.
- Having a _tree_ like shape is important because it allows the compiler to conduct multiple-passes while generating the machine language without having to re-parse the original source code.
- In this phase, some degree of error checking is also there

### Semantic Analysis

- In this phase, the parse tree is used to detect any logical errors such as assigning a wrong type to a variable, undeclared variable usage etc, and in general three things are done: Type checking, Flow control checking and Label checking.
- The compiler makes a complete traversal of the parse tree (abstract syntax tree or AST) and produces an _Annotated AST_ which also describes the values of its attributes

```sh
$ clang -Xclang -ast-dump <filename.c>
```

### Intermediate Code Generation

During this step, our code gets translated into a language somewhat b/w pure assembly and the source language (_Intermediate Language_)

```sh 
$ clang -Xclang -disableO0-optnone -S -emit-llvm <code.c>
```

### Code Optimization 

- The compiler uses a variety of techniques to enhance the efficiency of our code, which is done at the intermediate code level because machine code is hard to optimize because of the platform dependency
- Optimization generally leads to faster execution speeds and/ or smaller binary sizes 
- There are three rules that must be absolutely followed at this stage:
	- The program must consume fewer resources than before 
	- The original meaning of the program must not change due to optimization 
	- It shouldn't be too time consuming

Check this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15548023/clang-optimization-levels) to understand more about code optimization flags.

### Code Generation 

The optimised intermediate code is then converted fully into the machine code (`.o`/ `.obj`)


## Linking

### Basics

- It's the process of combining various pieces of code and data into a single file that can be loaded into the memory and executed. All this magic is performed by **Linker**
- The linker takes in an object file, looks for unresolved symbols and find where they exist with the help of relocation information and either place them into our main code (static linking) or do something which would lead to them being resolved at runtime (dynamic linking)

### What are symbols?

- Symbols are identifiers that are used to identify something when they’re used outside of where they were declared 
- They are stored in a symbol table which is built during the assembly phase. We can inspect them using nm/ readelf.


```nasm showLineNumbers
global _start

section .text
	_start:
		xor RAX, RAX
		mov ECX, someLabelName

section .data
	someLabelName: dw 0x1234
```

If we convert the above assembly into its corresponding ELF, and try to read the symbols using `nm`:

```sh
$ nasm code.asm -o objectfile.o -f elf64
$ ld objectfile.o -o finalExecutable
$ nm -a ./finalExecutable

# These are all the things which are referenced outside of where they have been declared, so they count as symbols
0000000000402002 D __bss_start
0000000000402002 D _edata
0000000000402008 D _end
0000000000000000 a hi.asm
0000000000402000 d someLabelName
0000000000401000 T _start
```

- Lowercase is used to denote that the symbol is local, and uppercase is used to denote that it is an external symbol.
- Symbol binding can either be local or global. Only the static symbols are local scoped, rest all are given Global and Global (extern). Local non-static variables are of no interest to the linker and are managed on the runtime stack.
- Symbols can either be Strong (defined functions/ initialised variables), or weak (uninitialised variables). Multiple symbols with the same name are not allowed, and a strong symbol is always picked over the weak.

Type of symbol | Description
-|-
A | Absolute Symbol
B | In the BSS section
D | In the data section 
N | Debugging symbol used for debugging
T | In the text section
U | Undefined

### The symbol table

A symbol table is used to store information about the symbols

```c 
typedef struct {
	int	  name;	  	/* offset into the string table that points to the null terminated string name of the symbol */
	char	type,	  	/* Function or data (4 bits) */
	binding: 4;   	/* Local or global */
	char	reserved;	/* Unused */
	short	section;	/* Which section this symbol is associated to, viz. index in the section header table */
	long	value;		/* The address */
	long	size;	  	/* Object size in bytes */
} Elf64_Symbol;
```

### How an object file looks like (ELF perspective)

```
              ┌─────────────┐
              │ ELF header  │ Basic information about the object file
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .text       │ Contains the code that we write
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .rodata     │ Read only data
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .data       │ Contains globally initialized data
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .bss        │ Contains globally uninitialized data, stuff present in the bss section doesn't need memory
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .symtab     │ The symbol table
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .rel.text   │ Relocation information (more on this later)
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .rel.data   │ Relocation information (more on this later)
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .debug      │ Debugging symbol table
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .line       │ Mapping b/w original code and machine instructions
              ├─────────────┤
              │ .strtab     │ String table
              ├─────────────┤
              │ Section     │ Useful information for linking (not execution)
              │ header table│
              └─────────────┘
```

Apart from the things discussed above, there are a bunch of other miscellaneous but important things too, such as
`.PLT` (Procedural Linkage Table) and `.GOT` (Global Offset Table): They are used to resolve library calls and are useful in the case of dynamic linking

:::info What is the ELF file format?

I've been throwing the term ELF for a while now, but never got about explaining it. ELF stands for Executable and Linkable Format. It contains the program data, the code, and some metadata which is used to determine how it can be linked and loaded in the memory

It’s the successor of the COFF (Common Object File Format) of \*NIX like operating systems.
:::

### Static Linking

- The object files of the functions which are called using libraries, is created and linked together during the linking phase to create an executable, making the size of the executable large.
- This approach is good for particular libraries if some of its functions are used a lot of times, but each time something gets changed in the library, the whole executable needs to be recreated.

![Preprocessing](/img/docs/programming/execution/static-linking.png)

#### Phase 1: Symbol Resolution

- During the assembly phase, a symbol table is generated, which lists out all the symbols in an object module. 
- During this phase, symbol resolution takes place, by which a single definition to each symbol is found and associated with, which is done by going through unresolved symbols, and finding the places where they actually exist viz. mapping of symbol names to their definition
- If more than one symbol exists with the same name, then the concept of strong/ weak symbols is brought into the picture. 
- The C linker goes through the whole codebase in a single pass, and takes note of unresolved symbol references as they occur, and as soon as the definitions are found, place them on the symbol table. 
- The following information is maintained: set of relocatable object files that will be merged to form the executable (E), set of unresolved symbols (U), and set of symbols that have been defined in the previous input files (D)

#### Phase 2: Symbol Relocation

- At the end of the previous phase, all the symbols get resolved with their correct definitions, this phase is all about creating the final executable and fixing the references to these symbols.
- A new executable is created which has the combined .text and .data section of all the libraries, along with that of its main program.
- Now that we know the correct definitions for symbols, we can fix the references made to these symbols with their correct runtime addresses, that were left zeroed out as placeholders during the assembly phase because the assembler didn’t know what their runtime address would be in the program address space
- The linker will look at the relocation tables (.rel.text and .rel.data) to see which symbols need relocation (the zeroed out ones). All resolved symbols’s definitions will have specific addresses in the newly created executable, and these address will be put into those placeholders.


### Dynamic Linking

```c
typedef struct {
	long offset; /* Offset of the reference which needs to be relocated */
	long type;   /* How to modify the reference, there are 32 relocation types in the ELF format */
	symbol;      /* Index in the symbol table, used to find the resolved address for the symbol */
	long addend; /* Used by some implementations to change the value of modified reference */
} Elf64_Rela;
```

- Another approach is to not link the object files during linking phase, and instead use a dynamic linker to link the global variables at load time and link the library functions at invocation time, keeping the size of the binary small.
- References to library object modules will be fixed during the invocation time, and these will be just pointers to where they’re located in memory, they will not be put into our binary, allowing multiple processes sharing the same set of libraries and saving memory.
- Static linking leads to wastage of a lot of memory because the same library code is loaded along with the main executable multiple times. And whenever there’s some change made to any library, the executable needs to be recreated. By this technique, the executable need not be re-created every time some changes are made into the library code, and the library code can stay in L1 cache ensuring super fast access either as shared object .so (Linux) or .dll (Windows) 


## Loading

### Understanding ELF program headers

Segment/ program headers contain information about how can this program be loaded and executed into the memory, they’re not needed on linktime (to remember: think about the segmentation memory model)

There are two important keywords that we must absolutely understand:
- `INTERP`: Defines the library that should be used to load this ELF into the memory
- `LOAD`: defines the part of the file that should be loaded into the memory

```sh
$ readelf -a ./a.out | less

Program Headers:
  Type           Offset             VirtAddr           PhysAddr
                 FileSiz            MemSiz              Flags  Align
  PHDR           0x0000000000000040 0x0000000000000040 0x0000000000000040

                 0x000000000000001c 0x000000000000001c  R      0x1

                 0x0000000000000618 0x0000000000000618  R      0x1000
  LOAD           0x0000000000001000 0x0000000000001000 0x0000000000001000

```

### How loading takes place?

- To figure out what to load and how to load, the Linux kernel reads the beginning of the file (magic section in the ELF header)
- If the file starts with a shebang #!, it means there is a specific loader (interpreter and the likes) which can help execute this program. The kernel extracts the interpreter path and name from the line, and calls it, with the original file as its argument
- If the file format matches with something present in /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc, the kernel executes the interpreter/ loader specified for that format, with the original file as an argument

```sh
$ ls -1 /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/

jar
llvm-14-runtime.binfmt
python3.10
register
status
```

- If the ELF is dynamically linked, the kernel reads the interpreter/ loader defined in the ELF, loads the interpreter and the original file, and transfer control to the interpreter. If the ELF is statically linked, the kernel will just load it

### How a dynamically linked ELF gets loaded into the memory

The program and its interpreter are loaded by the kernel into the memory by the steps discussed above, and the interpreter further loads libraries into the logical address space of our current program. The interpreter path is specified and can be checked by using readelf -a  program | grep "interpreter" and can be overwritten by using `patchelf`

The interpreter locates the libraries, and they can be found at:

- `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable, and anything in `/etc/ld.so.preload`
- `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable
- `DT_RUNPATH`/ `DT_RPATH` specified in the binary
- system wide configuration `/etc/ld.so.conf`
- `/lib` and `/usr/lib`

The interpreter loads the libraries

## Execution

If we look at the ELF header, there is something called the **Entry Point Address** which is used to specify where the execution flow will jump at the start, after the execution of the said ELF starts
If we look at the `objdump` of the said binary, and look for the address mentioned in the _Entry Point Address_ field, we find:


![Preprocessing](/img/docs/programming/execution/objdump.png)


We notice there is a call to the `__libc_start_main()` function (since the binary was compiled with `libc`), if it's not, the `_start` directly contains the instructions to execute

- A normal ELF calls `__libc_start_main()` in libc, and the library in turn will call the ELF’s `main()` function if our program is compiled and linked with `libc`
- Our ELF reads the environment variables (`void **envp`)and the arguments provided to it (`void **argv`)

```c
int main(int argc, void **argv, void **envp);
```
