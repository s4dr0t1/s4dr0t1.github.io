## Execution of interpreted languages

- The interpreter acts as a software simulation of a machine whose fetch-decode-execute deals with high level language program statements rather than machine instructions viz. the interpreter takes in instructions in the high level language, and execute them on their behalf.
- The whole code is not compiled into machine instructions all at once, but is rather read by an interpreter line-by-line, decoded, and the interpreter execute the code on our behalf, it’s got specific instruction for everything already (an instruction:machineCode mapping)
- No need for knowledge about the target machine, since an interpreter executes the code, and it makes it very easy to write cross-platform applications since the interpreter will handle all the low level intricacies.
- There are disadvantages too, such as slower execution time, decoding a statement every time its executed, larger space requirements
- **Example**: Ruby, Lisp, Powershell, Shell etc.

## Execution of intermediate languages

- A program written in such language is compiled into an intermediate form known as its Bytecode, which is done to decouple away the language from the execution environment
- Once the bytecode is generated which is platform dependent (native to the virtual machine), it can either be:
	- **Interpreted**: VM can convert the bytecode into platform specific operations, and thus we get speed (no line by line decoding), and debugging capabilities (because it’s interpreted)
	- **JIT compiled**: The bytecode is taken, and is compiled into its machine code equivalent (not AOT, but as and when a certain functionality is needed)
- Sometimes, we may get an option for both compilation and interpretation. The interpretation is for the testing phase, and after a bug-free stage is reached, the programs are compiled to increase their execution speed.
