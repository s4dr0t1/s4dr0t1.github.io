Hello internet stranger! My name is Rohit and I am a threat detection engineer by trade, I currently work at [CRED](https://cred.club), a leading fintech startup based in India and help secure their infrastructure _day-in-day-out_.

I recently completed my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [MNIT Jaipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaviya_National_Institute_of_Technology,_Jaipur).

I have been **extremely** interested in computing from a very young age. I find it incredibly fulfilling to break things down, and then try to understand how they work from the ground up. When I'm not doing the _tech_ things, I indulge in other hobbies of mine: anime, gaming, gym, and music.

Over the years, I've developed many interests when it comes to computing, which are mentioned below in no particular order:
- **blue teaming stuff**: detection engineering, incident response, security operations, cloud security, cyber threat intelligence, wireless and network security
- **systems and low-level computing**: operating system internals, hypervisors, binary exploitation, reverse engineering, computer architecture and trusted computing
- **other security stuff**: applied cryptography, networking, online privacy and digital security
- **other computing interests**: infrastructure engineering, parallelism and compilers

My contact information is available [here](/contact). To get an idea of the things that I've been working on recently, check [this](/now) out.
