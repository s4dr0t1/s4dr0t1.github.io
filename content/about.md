### A computer science undergraduate with a penchant for offensive security

I am pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science from [MNIT Jaipur](https://wiki.metastem.su/#/wiki/Malaviya%20National%20Institute%20of%20Technology%2C%20Jaipur/en). I always have been interested in cybersecurity from a very young age. 

In no specific order, my interests include:
- cryptography
- network security
- systems programming
- operating systems internals
- wireless communication
- privacy and digital security
- hypervisors
- trusted computing
- computer architecture

Other than the aforementioned things, I also enjoy reading up about programming language theory, site reliability engineering, and distributed systems.

Currently investing my time in researching Windows internals, Trusted Platform Module (TPMs) and reverse engineering device drivers. I mostly code in C and Rust, and use Bash for automation. I'm also familiar with Python, Lua, C++ and the Nix expression language.
