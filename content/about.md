### A Computer Science undergraduate with a penchant for offensive security.


I am pursuing my bachelors in Computer Science from [MNIT Jaipur](https://wiki.metastem.su/#/wiki/Malaviya%20National%20Institute%20of%20Technology%2C%20Jaipur/en).

I always have been interested in cybersecurity from a very young age. I tinker with all sorts of things, from systems, computer networks, wireless communication, operating systems to hypervisors and their security. I care about online privacy and digital security. 

Other than the aforementioned things, I also enjoy reading up about programming language theory, site reliability engineering, and distributed systems. Currently investing my time in binary analysis, reverse engineering and the Nix package management ecosystem.

I mostly code in C and Rust, and use Bash for automation.
