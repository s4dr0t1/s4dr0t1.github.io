So I decided to do something new that I'd never done before -- Log my work (Y). Inspiration credits go to [injuly](https://injuly.in/now/) who meticulously maintains a monthly log of stuff he's working on, and decided I should be doing the same, 'cause why not?

Currently reading about PKI and [Serious Cryptography](https://nostarch.com/serious-cryptography-2nd-edition) (**again**!? which I had abandoned 2-3 times in the past; but this time I have high hopes that I'll finish it cover to cover), this book is fucking bonkers!
Other than this, I am reading up some stuff regarding databases, and LLMs.

In my free time, I've been playing the [Tomb Raider trilogy](https://www.tombraider.com/news/video-games/tomb-raider-definitive-survivor-trilogy-available-now) and watching [Justified](https://thetvdb.com/series/justified).
[Assassin's Creed Shadows](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows) came out recently and it looks really cool, I'm thinking of getting that too.
