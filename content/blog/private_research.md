Hello!

I've been conducting private research and documenting my journey for some time now. I've decided to share it all online for others to learn from.


Because I've switched from Notion to Obsidian, my work is currently scattered across both platforms. For the time being, I am publishing my work as a Notion page, but with time, I will publish all of that in a markdown-format, fully formatted and tagged, on this website itself.

Until then, please make do with my Notion links [1](https://ph7uz62f75pe4wpr9ngzmfiy.notion.site/Essentials-20c08fa3411243dc8e0742d5ed7842d6?pvs=4) and [2](https://ph7uz62f75pe4wpr9ngzmfiy.notion.site/Information-Security-acaacb419a434cb884529defcd40e9d1?pvs=4).

And also, don't forget my archive from the previous iteration of this website: [GitHub](https://github.com/s4dr0t1/s4dr0t1.github.io/tree/docusauras-archive/docs)


There's a lot more to come from my Obsidian vault, all of which you'll see on my website in some time.
